We’re excited to share that Issue 4 of The Manual has shipped and is being printed. Although we’re expanding beyond print (more on that next week!), this is a big moment for us, and we want to share some details about the issue with you.

## Six New Authors, Beautiful New Design

Issue 4 marks the beginning of a new three-issue volume and features six articles and six lessons from voices you’ll recognize: [Jennifer Brook](https://twitter.com/jenniferbrook), [David Cole](https://twitter.com/irondavy), [Paul Ford](https://twitter.com/ftrain), [Diana Kimball](https://twitter.com/dianakimball), [Wilson Miner](https://twitter.com/wilsonminer), and [Craig Mod](https://twitter.com/craigmod). All have smart, reflective takes, and we’re looking forward to opening them to a broader community.

The print edition of our new issue has a completely new design by Frank Chimero of [Another](http://ofanother.com/). It comes in a beautiful A5 hardback format with a foil-stamped, full cotton cover and is printed on 96 pages by [Oddi](http://www.oddi.com/), our trusted longtime printer in Reykjavík, Iceland.

It will be available in our shop toward the end of September for pre-orders and begin shipping in early October — but if you’d like a sneak peek, check out Wilson Miner’s article, [“Perennial Design.”](http://alwaysreadthemanual.com/issues/4/wilson-miner/article)
