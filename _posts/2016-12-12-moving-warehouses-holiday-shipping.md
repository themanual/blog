Hello again! Earlier this year, I [shared with you my decision](http://blog.themanual.org/2016/04/04/hiatus) to put The Manual on indefinite hiatus as I work to step back from my role as publisher, and to prioritize taking better care of myself.

First, I owe all of you an enormous debt of gratitude for your support and kindness in the aftermath of this announcement. It was, and continues to be, a heartbreakingly difficult decision, but progress is being made and I’m hoping to have some good news about the future of The Manual early next year.

It’s buoying that, despite the hiatus, The Manual continues to be incredibly popular. Our articles and lessons continue to be shared far and wide, and we’re still regularly shipping copies of our beautiful books all around the world.

## Moving warehouses

In an effort to reduce regular monthly costs—and given that most of the books we ship go to addresses in the U.S—I’ve made the decision to consolidate our stock of print editions at a local fulfillment operation here in Portland, OR.

To assist with the move, we’re [reducing the cost of our print editions to just $5](http://shop.themanual.org) through the end of December, so we’re transporting as little stock as possible from our current warehouses in January. Now is a great time to complete your collection or purchase an issue to gift to a friend!

[Buy your copy of The Manual now for just $5](http://shop.themanual.org)!

## Holiday shipping

Our fulfillment company is recommending any domestic orders be placed **no later than December 16th** in order to arrive in good time for December 25th. If you’re further afield, the sooner the better! All orders leave our warehouse same day, and most ship with tracking.

Happy holidays, and again, thank you for your support!
