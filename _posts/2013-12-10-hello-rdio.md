synopsis: An application for a design intership at Rdio.

Since I began freelancing, working for a company again has crossed my mind more than once. But I'd only do it if I could work on something that I need, use and love. However, the number of products that I use *every single day* is very small.[^fn-listary] One of those products is [Rdio][rdio].

Last week, Rdio's Head of Design [Wilson Miner][miner] [tweeted][tweet] a job opening for a Design Intern at Rdio. Being a subscriber and a fan of Rdio for over a year[^fn-fake], as well as an admirer of the work some of the people in their design team have done, I didn't even think twice.

I didn't have a portfolio or even a resumé ready, but just like Wanstrath, I don't think that was the best way of presenting myself. So I began preparing a custom webpage where I could write about what I love to do, show something I had done, and present it in such a way that — I believe — proved that I'm good at it.

I finished it by Friday, when most fellow europeans had already left work: [paulozoom.com/rdio](http://paulozoom.com/rdio)

I honestly believe it's some of my best work, and I'm really happy with it, specially considering the timeframe. I got much love and great feedback from my peers on [Twitter][twitter] and [Dribbble][dribbble]. But only Rdio knows who applied and who's the best for the role.

This is a great opportunity. I'm crossing my fingers.

[^fn-listary]: I don't even use Listary every day. Most of the time I use it through nvALT.

[^fn-fake]: I used a fake postal address so I could sign up before it was available in Portugal.
