We headed to Women’s Audio Mission in San Francisco, California last week to record all our articles and lessons in the upcoming [Issue 4][issue-4] with [our narrator][roman-mars], Roman Mars of 99% Invisible — and today we’re happy to share two samples with you.

Interested? Listen to our Letter from the Publisher to get a feel for what’s in store in Issue 4:

We’d like to thank [Roman Mars](https://twitter.com/romanmars) for his excellent narration and all the talented folks at [Women’s Audio Mission](http://womensaudiomission.org) for their outstanding work in recording and editing our issue. We especially want to thank Terri Winston, WAM’s executive director, and Laura Dean, the engineer with whom we worked on this project. The entire project could not have gone more smoothly, and we look forward to working with them again in the future.

We have much more in the works for October as we open pre-orders on our print books and ramp up production on our ebooks – stay tuned!
