We’re writing to you this week from Women’s Audio Mission in San Francisco, where we’re recording with Roman Mars, the narrator of the audiobook edition of [Issue 4](http://blog.themanual.org/2014/09/01/inside-issue-4/).

[Roman](https://twitter.com/romanmars) is the creator of [99% Invisible](http://99percentinvisible.org/), a radio show about design, architecture, and the 99% invisible activity that shapes our world. He’s an internationally-known voice, fantastic speaker, and incredible creative talent, and we’re truly excited to work with him.

We also are thrilled to share we’re recording Issue 4 at [Women’s Audio Mission](http://www.womensaudiomission.org/), the only non-profit recording studio in the United States that’s owned and operated entirely by women. Women’s Audio Mission is dedicated to the training and advancement of women in music production and the recording arts, where women traditionally are significantly under-represented.

We’re grateful to [David McCreath](http://twitter.com/mccreath) of [It Might Get Personal](http://itmightgetpersonal.com/) for introducing us to Terri Winston, the organization’s founder, and excited to build a relationship with the team there. You can follow Terri and the WAM crew on Twitter [@womensaudio](https://twitter.com/womensaudio) and find more information on their classes and community work at [womensaudiomission.org](http://www.womensaudiomission.org/).

We’ll share further audiobook details in the future as we move toward recording further issues – [join us @themanual](https://twitter.com/themanual) to keep tabs on our progress and [sign up for email updates](http://campaigns.fiction.co/h/y/89D36748DA189402) if you’d like advance looks at what’s in the works!
