When we launched [our Kickstarter to build The Manual, Everywhere][ks], we hoped we also might welcome new readers from the expanding community that has grown around the discussion and practice of designing for the web. In the past few weeks, as we [blogged][blog] and [tweeted][twitter] and talked with folks online and off, we saw our expectations — like our goal — surpassed by new ranks who were excited about what we publish and why.

Our mission is to focus on why we design — the thought and decision that goes into the work that we create for all those screens in our lives — rather than tutorials or interviews. The aforementioned all are distinctly valuable, but we’re most interested in the former, and other smart publications (like our friends at [A List Apart][ala], [Smashing Magazine][smashing], [Offscreen][offscreen], and [The Great Discontent][tgd]) already are covering the latter in exemplary ways.

So over the past three years, we’ve focused on timeless, thoughtful articles and powerful, personal lessons about [people][people], [history][history], [culture][culture], philosophy, and design theory, all applied to the web. Below are a few favorites from our [first three issues][volume-i], which are all available in our [free, open web edition][web]:

* Issue 1: [The Space Between You and Me][space], by Frank Chimero
* Issue 2: [The Colors of Grief][colors], by Alex Charchar
* Issue 3: [Practicing Passion][passion], by Tiffani Jones Brown

If you work (or _want_ to work) _in_ or _with_ design on the web, and you like to think about (or _want_ to understand better) what that means for how we build, The Manual is for you. For makers, that includes designers, engineers, PMs, and team leads, among others. But it also includes people who simply enjoy good writing, because what we publish is applicable in a broader way to life.

Design, by nature, is a practice of connecting people; the web, in its purest sense, is a mechanism that does the same. We hope to evaluate both for years to come, and [we welcome you to join us.][web]
