For the past 19 months, The Manual has been on somewhat of an unplanned hiatus. Lots of small problems and delays have quietly nudged us to where we are now, over a year and a half outside of our original publishing schedule. Today, that comes to an end.

Today, a sea change. Count this as the first of many announcements (here on our spiffy new blog!) as The Manual returns to a regular schedule, with a new website, brand new digital editions, and a few new faces joining our team.

Currently, an early version of our new website — including a full archive of every article and lesson — is almost complete, and just a few weeks away from a private beta. Our digital editions have been sent out to a small group of readers, and will soon be available to all. I am returning to my role as publisher full-time, and Paulo Pereira has also joined The Manual, focussing on the launch of the website and digital editions.

Issue 4 is a few weeks from heading to the printer, but we wanted to share something early with you today. Wilson Miner has written a beautiful piece, [“Perennial Design”](http://alwaysreadthemanual.com/issues/4/wilson-miner/article), for the next issue, which we’ve set in an early version of our new website, free for everyone to enjoy.

Today is just the beginning.
