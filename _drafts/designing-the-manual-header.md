## Header Design

I’ve lost count of how many times I redesigned the header, always unhappy with some fundamental part of it. The Manual is not a brand new publication, and we worked with real content as soon as we could, which proved invaluable as it created a few hard constraints we had to work with.

The bigger of those was the illustrations. Look around on web publications, and you'll see a pattern: most of them use landscape illustration or photography. They wouldn't look so good on a printed book or magazine, where full-page portrait pictures really shine, but are much more convenient to design with on the web. They [look great at full page width][ala] without pushing content too far down the page, and are also often capable of [accommodating words over empty space][stet].

Originally a print-only publication, The Manual’s article illustrations have always had a portrait aspect ratio, which proved very hard to work with. Furthermore, their usually detailed and self-contained nature makes them shine at the center of their own white page, and don't work as well when made too small or viewed only partially.

So I had to ensure that the illustrations were viewable in their entirety most of the time; the article’s title, synopsis, and author weren’t being pushed too far down the page; and enough room remained to accommodate any title length[^fn-titles] — another major constraint. Put this way, the solution I came up with seems overly obvious, but I'm can only articulate these constraints and requirements because/as they became clear/clearer after/due to tireless experimentation.

[^fn-titles]: As a curiosity, “Hyper” by Duane King for Issue 3 is the shortest title, while “Ear Trumpets and Bionic Superpowers” by Karen McGrane for Issue 2 is the longest.
